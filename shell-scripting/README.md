Introduction to Shell Scripting tutorial and its relevance to DevOps engineers.
Automation through shell scripting helps reduce manual tasks and streamline activities on Linux systems.
Shell scripting is the process of automating day-to-day activities on Linux systems using script files.
"touch" command creates files, essential for automation scripts. "ls" lists files, "-ltr" sorts by timestamp.
Use "man" command to access the manual for any Linux command and understand its usage and options.
Basic commands learned so far: "ls" for listing files, "touch" for file creation, "man" for accessing command manuals.
Use terminal tools like "Vim" or "VI" to create and edit shell script files.
Start a shell script with a shebang ("#!") line specifying the interpreter, like "/bin/bash" for Bash scripting.
Choose the appropriate shell interpreter for your scripting needs, with Bash being a widely used option.
Be cautious of using "/bin/sh" in scripts, as system defaults might vary (e.g., "sh" pointing to "dash" in some systems). Prefer "/bin/bash" to ensure compatibility.
Always use `/bin/bash` as the shebang in shell scripts to ensure compatibility, as some systems may use `dash` or other shells by default.
In Linux, use the `echo` command to print text, analogous to using print statements in other programming languages.
Vim is used to create and edit files in the command line. Entering "insert mode" allows you to type text, and pressing "esc" returns to command mode.
The `cat` command prints the contents of a file without opening it, providing a quick way to view file contents.
Execute a shell script using either `sh scriptname` or `./scriptname`. The latter is used for executable files. Make sure to set execute permissions using `chmod +x scriptname` if needed.
Linux requires proper permissions to execute files. Use `chmod` to assign read, write, and execute permissions for different user categories: user, group, and others. Numeric values like 777 or 444 represent these permissions.
`chmod` permissions follow the 4-2-1 convention: 4 for read, 2 for write, and 1 for execute. Use these values to grant permissions to different users.
The `history` command displays a list of previously executed commands, which can be helpful for referencing or repeating commands.
`pwd` displays the present working directory, showing your current location in the file system.
Use `mkdir` to create directories (folders), and navigate between directories using `cd`. `cd ..` moves up one directory level.
PWD command for present working directory.
MKDIR for creating directories.
CD for changing directories.
Writing a simple shell script for creating files and folders.
Using comments in shell scripts with the "#" symbol.
Shell script to create files and folders.
Using CHMOD for changing permissions.
Executing shell script and creating files and folders.
Shell scripting for automating DevOps tasks.
Use case: Automated node health monitoring of virtual machines.
DevOps engineers use shell scripting for infrastructure and configuration management.
Use of "top" command to monitor processes and resources.
Advanced topics in shell scripting, like trapping signals and cron jobs.
